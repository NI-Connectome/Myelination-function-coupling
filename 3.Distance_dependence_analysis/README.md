This folder contains the program 'Distance_dependence_analysis.m' used to calculate the distance dependence of MFC. 

Firstly, divide vertices into 50 vertex-specific parts of equal size based on vertex-to-vertex distance. Then, calculate MFC of each vertex-spacific parts for the demo dHCP subject (ID: sub-CC00056XX07 ses-10700).

For the vertex-to-vertex geodesic distance matrix on the mid-thickness surafce required to support this code, the file is too large to upload, please click the link below to download: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HInFx6VNqg0eAf_j5_fQzA?pwd=n2ef

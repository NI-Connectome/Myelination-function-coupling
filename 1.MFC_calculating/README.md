This folder contains the code required to calculate MFC, demo data to support the code, and the calculation results for demo data.

Specifically,

The program 'MFC_calculating.m' includes calculating FC, gMC, sMC, MFC, gMFC, and sMFC, and visualizing brain maps.

The subfolder 'data' includes cortical myelin data for calculating MC, the calculated FC and network label.

The subfolder 'result' includes calculted MFC 'Result_MFC_DemoSub.mat', its nifti type file 'MFC_DemoSub.dtseries.nii' /'gMFC_DemoSub.dtseries.nii' /'sMFC_DemoSub.dtseries.nii', and surface file required to visual MFC. The visualization effect is as shown in Figure 'DemoSub_brainmap_MFC.png'.
